            Some of my biggest programming projects are in Java. Here, you will find a project called <strong>Creative Space</strong>, a drawing program similar to
            applications like Paint and Photoshop—only simpler. This project was created alongside Taylor Yang, another junior at ECG.    
            </p>

        <div class = "CreativeSpace">
            <br>
            <h2>C R E A T I V E &nbsp; S P A C E</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
            With this project, the goal was to create something that resembles programs like Paint or Photoshop (though a bit simpler in terms of functionality).
            We wanted to have a program that could draw shapes and lines of varying colors, shapes, and sizes, with an eraser, layers, the ability to undo/redo, 
            and also clear the pane.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            When the user first runs the program, they will see a large window that should be the size of their screen, depending on the device. The window is 
            titled “Creative Space”. On the left side of the screen, there is a sidebar with a series of interactive elements such as buttons and sliders, 
            organized by categories using labels and button colors. The first two buttons fall under the ‘Brushes’ category: one brush is an eraser and the other 
            is just a drawing brush, like a digital pen or pencil. If the user selects the drawing brush, they can drag their mouse across the screen to draw 
            or write what they want. The eraser works the same way: the user can drag across the screen to erase what they want. In addition to the eraser 
            function, I also added a ‘Clear All’ button, which allows the user to clear the screen of all visible elements and start on a fresh, blank slate. 
            I added this function to make it easier to get rid of things without having to manually do so with the eraser.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next set of buttons is called ‘Shapes’, in which the user can draw circles, rectangles, ellipses, and lines. If the setting for the outline and 
            fill are not altered, no matter what shape is drawn, it will be transparent by default with a thin, black outline. If the user changes the line weight 
            using the slider, none of the current shapes drawn on the pane will be altered, but any new shapes will be drawn with the changed line weight. 
            This concept also applies to shapes drawn after the fill color/stroke color are changed. Once the user clicks, drags, and releases, a new shape or 
            line will be added to the current layer, depending on what button was selected. 
            Shapes are drawn from the starting point of where the mouse was clicked to the point where the mouse was released. 
            This was done using event.getX() and event.getY() methods.
            </p>
            <p>
            The final sets of buttons are for undoing and redoing actions, adding and removing layers, and adding images. 
            All layers are added to a stack, and they stack up upon one another. Layers are not visible to the user, they are simply invisible drawing panes. 
            We established a redoHistory and an undoHistory for the redo/undo buttons. These essentially keep track of the actions by the user so they can undo 
            and redo. The ‘Add Image’ button allows the user to access their file directory on their device and add an image to their drawing. 
            Parts of the image can be erased, drawn on top of, and cleared altogether.

            Over the course of the last year, I've been developing my understanding of Python. The two projects you'll find below are largely about
            data analysis and the use of graphs. The first project is an analysis of COVID mortality rates in Maryland from last summer, using real data from the 
            time the project was created. The second project is a simulation of what weathering would look like on a mountain over time using animation. This 
            project also uses real data and incorporates it into the simulation and the design of the terrain itself. 
            </p>

            <div class = "COVID">
                <br>
                <h2>M A R Y L A N D &nbsp; C O V I D &nbsp; M O R T A L I T Y &nbsp; R A T E S</h2>
                <h2>2 0 2 0 &nbsp; A N A L Y S I S</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                I used real data from a .csv file containing COVID-19 mortality rates for states across the country, focusing on Maryland for this project. 
                I used the death rates to create a series of graphs to eventually calculate the approximate mortality rate of the state.
                </p>
                In most of my graphs, I had to find dy and dx, smooth them, divide, graph it, and then examine the end of the graph. The number the line in the 
                final graph appears to approach was the approximate the mortality rate. My final result was a Jupyter notebook with a graph of
                smoothdy / smoothdx and an added text field explaining what limit I estimated.
                </p>
                <p>
                First, I put all the positive cases over time into an actual graph that made the data easier to visualize and understand. I created another graph for 
                the deaths over time as well. Then, I graphed the derivates for both of the above graphs, and smoothed them out to make them easier to understand.
                This laid the foundation for my next step.
                </p>
                Finally, I plotted smooth dx over smooth dy, combining the previous two graphs into one to estimate the mortality rate. I zoomed in on the very 
                end of the first graph to approximate the mortality rate as best I can. My results are shown in the images below.
                <p>
                <p>
                <strong>Results Summary: </strong>
                Over time, the mortality rate decreases (with some extremely small spikes that become noticeable near the end). 
                The mortality rate seemed to come close to about 2% at first, but I had to zoom in to get a more accurate value. 
                The mortality rate approached about 1.8%, which was just over half the mortality rate from the beginning of the pandemic (which was 3.4%)!

                This project was created alongside another junior ECG student, Natalie Earnhardt.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project entails the creation of a simulation using real data. It was completed in September, after just taking an environmental science course. I was also developing an interest in animation at the time I began working on this.
                Simulation: what erosion would look like on rough or mountain-like terrain. Making this simulation was difficult because no exact formula 
                could calculate erosion rates due to the many natural processes and factors involved.
                One of the first deliverables of the project was the generation of a realistic, 3D surface plot. I created a .csv file with over five thousand 
                coordinates to generate a piece of rough terrain.
                Each coordinate represented an altitude. To display it through code, I transformed it to a long format, and then added an animation that could 
                make the graph rotate and display all the angles of the terrain. To make the graph rotate, I used an azimuth angle.
                Four factors for erosion in the simulation: precipitation, wind speed, temperature, and humidity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interactive: factors are adjustable through the use of sliders. There is also a drop-down menu with four different soil types/compositions: 
                loam, clay, cropland, and limestone.
                In creating the formula, I created five variables: one for each factor, and a fifth variable for the land type. Each of the first four variables 
                were assigned maximum values. I figured out how to incorporate them into the formula with a series of if statements which standardized how much a certain value affected the simulation on a scale of zero to one. Different time scales were used on different land types for changes to be noticeable.
                The final formula adds all four, standardized variables together based on the land type and timescale. To create the final, animated graph 
                that would display the erosion rate, the first thing I did was convert the original file with the coordinates for the terrain into a scatterplot. 
                The graph moved based on a variable called ‘i’, which changed the altitudes of the plot over time using the formula.
                The final outcome of the project displays a 3D scatterplot of terrain which displayed the rate of erosion depending on the factors a user alters.
            
            <h3>P A R T &nbsp; O N E - T E R R A I N &nbsp; D I S P L A Y &nbsp;( S E E &nbsp; I M A G E &nbsp; O N E ) </h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this is to show a clear visualization of the mountain as the weathering animation is a scatterplot version of the terrain. 
                First, the required packages and files were imported for the display. Then, I transformed the data into a long format so that the plot could 
                be created. A trisurf command was used for the 3D plot because there was an x, y, and a z axis. To animate the visual, an azimuth angle was 
                used. An azimuth is an angular measurement in a spherical coordinate system. 
            </p>

            <h3> P A R T &nbsp; T W O - F I N A L &nbsp; A N I M A T I O N</h3>
            <p>
                To actually animate the graph and display the animation based on the factors, a formula was created using the variables defined in the code snippet. This formula is called the 
                'weathering factor’ (ef), and was put together after carefully analyzing all research and real data implemented in the project. 
                Finally, I added a print statement that calculated the erosion factor using the formula.
                The final graph is actually an animated 3D scatterplot because it was easier to work with rather than the other graph shown earlier. 
                That is why the line ax.scatter is used at the end of the # Creates the graph section.
                The graph was animated using anim (fig, frame, frames, blit, repeat). This produces the result.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Final results of a sample animation are displayed in the second image below.</strong>The final graph can display the change in 
                limestone over 2,000,000 years, the change in clay and cropland over 100 years, and it displays the change in loam over 50 years. 
                These were timescales that were used to show noticeable change. Below, watch the blue slider to see the animation of weathering occurring over 
                time for loam.
