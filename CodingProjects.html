            <h1>Java Projects</h1>
            <p>
            Some of my biggest programming projects are in Java. Here, you will find a project called <strong>Creative Space</strong>, a drawing program similar to
            applications like Paint and Photoshop—only simpler. This project was created alongside Taylor Yang, another junior at ECG.
            The other projects you will find on this page are related to my robotics team, <em><strong>FIRST</strong></em> <strong>Tech Challenge</strong>
            team #731 Wannabee Strange. These programs are all from within the last year.        
            </p>
            </div>

        <div class = "CreativeSpace">
            <h2>Creative Space</h2>
            <p>
            With this project, the goal was to create something that resembles programs like Paint or Photoshop (though a bit simpler in terms of functionality).
            We wanted to have a program that could draw shapes and lines of varying colors, shapes, and sizes, with an eraser, layers, the ability to undo/redo, 
            and also clear the pane.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            When the user first runs the program, they will see a large window that should be the size of their screen, depending on the device. The window is 
            titled “Creative Space”. On the left side of the screen, there is a sidebar with a series of interactive elements such as buttons and sliders, 
            organized by categories using labels and button colors. The first two buttons fall under the ‘Brushes’ category: one brush is an eraser and the other 
            is just a drawing brush, like a digital pen or pencil. If the user selects the drawing brush, they can drag their mouse across the screen to draw 
            or write what they want. The eraser works the same way: the user can drag across the screen to erase what they want. In addition to the eraser 
            function, I also added a ‘Clear All’ button, which allows the user to clear the screen of all visible elements and start on a fresh, blank slate. 
            I added this function to make it easier to get rid of things without having to manually do so with the eraser.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next set of buttons is called ‘Shapes’, in which the user can draw circles, rectangles, ellipses, and lines. If the setting for the outline and 
            fill are not altered, no matter what shape is drawn, it will be transparent by default with a thin, black outline. If the user changes the line weight 
            using the slider, none of the current shapes drawn on the pane will be altered, but any new shapes will be drawn with the changed line weight. 
            This concept also applies to shapes drawn after the fill color/stroke color are changed. Once the user clicks, drags, and releases, a new shape or 
            line will be added to the current layer, depending on what button was selected. 
            Shapes are drawn from the starting point of where the mouse was clicked to the point where the mouse was released. 
            This was done using event.getX() and event.getY() methods.
            </p>
            <p>
            The final sets of buttons are for undoing and redoing actions, adding and removing layers, and adding images. 
            All layers are added to a stack, and they stack up upon one another. Layers are not visible to the user, they are simply invisible drawing panes. 
            We established a redoHistory and an undoHistory for the redo/undo buttons. These essentially keep track of the actions by the user so they can undo 
            and redo. The ‘Add Image’ button allows the user to access their file directory on their device and add an image to their drawing. 
            Parts of the image can be erased, drawn on top of, and cleared altogether.
            </p>

            <h2>Highlights, Images, Descriptions</h2>

                    <strong>Gyro Functions - Concise Code (First Image)</strong>

                    <p>
                    While using the gyro, we set up our functions to be self correcting so that the robot would essentially be able to move back to its 
                    target path even if it has small errors. Encoders are used in a PID algorithm that tracks position and error to calculate motor power 
                    for drivetrain movements. To keep these functions from becoming too lengthy and unreadable, we set up other functions that could 
                    be universal to all our gyro drivetrain movement functions. This kept our code from becoming lengthy because of unnecessary duplicated 
                    code within similar functions.
                    <br>
                    Using the goForwardStraight function, all the embedded methods can be sought out and understood.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Vision (Second Image)</strong>
                    <p>
                    In the beginning of the season we decided on easyOpenCv as our choice of vision for the Ultimate Goal season. easyOpenCv is more efficient 
                    in terms of simplicity of code in comparison to other vision systems. We are using an external webcam for vision this year with the Control 
                    Hub. We had to make a Pipeline for detecting the number of rings in the starter stack during initialization to find which target zone to drop 
                    wobble goals in during  auto.
                    <br>
                    The main loop for figuring out how many rings are in the starter stack on the field looks like the code in the second image below. 
                    If the value of avg1 is greater than the constant for the four threshold, there are four rings present. The else statements for one and zero 
                    rings are similar. 
                    The rest of the pipeline defines everything needed for the webcam to do this.
