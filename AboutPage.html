        <div class = "AboutMe">
        <p>Six years ago, I said "I will never learn to code". I was an aspiring artist at the time. Little did I know that my paintbrush would guide
            me to the world of digitization. It started in middle school when I participated in a technology summer camp. I learned how to use blocks of code to 
            program lego robots and create new apps and video games online. This camp sparked my interest in computing, and I returned the next year as a 
            near-peer mentor with the hope of helping girls connect their passions to STEM. I remember one girl who loved to write, so I showed her how to 
            create interactive stories online. 
        </p>

            <img id = "ProfilePicture" src = "final_images/image11.jpeg" alt = "Profile Picture">
        
        <p>This led me to join my school’s robotics club as the marketing lead, where I created digital graphics for the club and launched a new website and 
            club logo. Being the marketing lead of my robotics club helped me connect my passion for graphic design to robotics, and my background in coding 
            also led me to take on an active role as a programmer on my robotics team. I progressed from having no interest in coding at all to developing a 
            passion for it and mentoring girls of all ages in STEM camps while also making significant contributions to my robotics team.
        </p>
        <p>	While mixing paint with pixels may seem like an odd combination or a glitch in a system, fusing art with technology is nothing short of wizardry to me. 
            Since the start of high school, I’ve always been fascinated with how code can be used to create stunning graphics, and for the last three years, 
            I’ve been working with creative cloud applications like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to explore the world of digital design. 
            I’ve used these applications to create designs for logos, t-shirts, flyers, and animations.
            As I continue to advance my programming and art skills, meshing code with 
            design could be the key to helping me unlock my potential.
