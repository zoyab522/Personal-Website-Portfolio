        <p>Hello! My name is Zoya, and I am a junior at the Early College at Guilford. I am a passionate artist and graphic designer,
            and I am also developing an interest in computer science. This site features my artwork (both traditional and digital), and my
            coding projects. I hope you enjoy my portfolio!

        <h1>Art Portfolio</h1>
        <p>From a very young age, I've always had a love for art. I'm mostly self-taught, but I have taken some fine arts classes to develop my skill 
            in mediums like charcoal, pastels, watercolors, and even oils. My main focus is in portraiture and photorealism with pencil drawings,
            but my styles range from drawings to paintings as well. I also do a lot of digital work using Adobe Photoshop and Procreate to create graphics
            on larger scales.
        </p>

        <h1>Coding Projects</h1>
        <p>Since 9th grade, I've been learning how to program robots using Java. Doing this has allowed me to branch out and mentor others in programming, and 
            participate in lots of tech workshops where I helped teach middle-school girls about the importance of STEM and robotics as a whole. I also have some
            background in Python from those tech workshops as well as some projects I created from a Scientific Computing course. Finally, I am currently developing
            my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
